Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate:
You can use the keytool command-line utility, which is included with Java, to generate a self-signed SSL certificate. Here's an example command to generate a self-signed certificate:


keytool -genkey -alias localhost -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks -validity 365 -keysize 2048
Export the Certificate:
After generating the keystore, you can export the certificate to be used in the truststore. Here's an example command to export the certificate:


keytool -export -alias localhost -file server.crt -keystore keystore.jks
Import the Certificate into Truststore:
Once you have the server.crt file from the previous step, you can import it into the truststore. Here's an example command to import the certificate into the truststore:


keytool -import -file server.crt -alias localhost -keystore truststore.jks
Configure Application with Keystore and Truststore:
Once you have the keystore.jks and truststore.jks files, you can use them in your Kafka application as specified in your docker-compose.yml file.


In your current setup using the wurstmeister/kafka Docker image, the Kafka container does not need to generate the keystore and truststore files itself. Instead, you can generate these files externally (e.g., on your local machine) and then mount them into the Kafka container using Docker volumes.

This approach allows you to manage the SSL certificates externally and provide them to the Kafka container for secure communication. The Kafka container will then use the provided keystore and truststore files as specified in its configuration for SSL/TLS communication.

By following the steps to generate the SSL certificates and create the keystore and truststore files on your local machine, you can ensure that the Kafka container has access to the necessary SSL configuration for secure communication with clients.
